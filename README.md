# 100DaysOfCode
The a challenge I have brought upon myself that will encourage me to code at least an hour a day. I have a lot of unfinished projects in this here repo that I intend to finish over the next ~3 months. I will learn some new things along the way as well.

## Day 1: December 5th, 2017
### What I did: 
Set myself up to use VS Code
### Thoughts: 
Well, I intended to begin work on understanding the new CSS grid stuff.. but I got caught up in implementing Visual Studio Code. I've been meaning to make the switch for a while now, but was always in the middle of something and didn't want to switch until I was starting something fresh.

## Day 2: December 6th, 2017
### What I did: 
Was introduced to a couple of CSS Grid basics
### Thoughts: 
Introduced to grid-template, grid-row-start/end and their shorthands. I got caught up in some VSCode stuff at the beginning... Its fast but I don't like not having all of my sweet Atom plugins.

## Day 3: December 7th, 2017
### What I did: 
Completed the introductory lectures on defining grids
### Thoughts:
My wife and I went out to dinner with friends this evening so I took it very light tonight. I finished the lecture series on how to define grids and change there sizes, order, etc... All introductory stuff. I am feeling pretty good about this course.. And I except that fact I won't be able to hit this hard every single night.

## Day 4: December 8th, 2017
### What I did:
Completed an excercise that tested my introductory grid knowledge.
### Thoughts:
It was a lot tricker to do it on my own than I would have expected. I actually had to take a peak at the solution to job my memory. I am glad I did though because after getting a small look, I was able to work through it and come to the solution on my own.

## Day 5: December 9th, 2017
### What I did:
Complete an excercise on grid order.
### Thoughts:
Another day where I had little time to do much of anything. I completed one simple excercise. But as I said before, there will be days liket his, especially on the weekends. Over 100 days, no matter how short some days efforts are, the work and experience will add up.

## Day 6: December 10, 2017
### What I did:
Learned more advanced CSS Grid techniques such as grid-template-areas and the repeate technique.
### Thoughts:
Ah, my tutorial moves hella fast and I know I missed some things. For example, using naming in my repeat funtion... WHAT? I will go through the excerices tomorrow and hopefully get a better grasp.
