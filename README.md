# 100DaysOfCode
The a challenge I have brought upon myself that will encourage me to code at least an hour a day. I have a lot of unfinished projects in this here repo that I intend to finish over the next ~3 months. I will learn some new things along the way as well.

## Day 1: December 5th, 2017
### What I did:
Set myself up to use VS Code
### Thoughts:
Well, I intended to begin work on understanding the new CSS grid stuff.. but I got caught up in implementing Visual Studio Code. I've been meaning to make the switch for a while now, but was always in the middle of something and didn't want to switch until I was starting something fresh.

## Day 2: December 6th, 2017
### What I did:
Was introduced to a couple of CSS Grid basics
### Thoughts:
Introduced to grid-template, grid-row-start/end and their shorthands. I got caught up in some VSCode stuff at the beginning... Its fast but I don't like not having all of my sweet Atom plugins.

## Day 3: December 7th, 2017
### What I did:
Completed the introductory lectures on defining grids
### Thoughts:
My wife and I went out to dinner with friends this evening so I took it very light tonight. I finished the lecture series on how to define grids and change there sizes, order, etc... All introductory stuff. I am feeling pretty good about this course.. And I except that fact I won't be able to hit this hard every single night.

## Day 4: December 8th, 2017
### What I did:
Completed an exercise that tested my introductory grid knowledge.
### Thoughts:
It was a lot more tricky to do it on my own than I would have expected. I actually had to take a peak at the solution to job my memory. I am glad I did though because after getting a small look, I was able to work through it and come to the solution on my own.

## Day 5: December 9th, 2017
### What I did:
Complete an exercise on grid order.
### Thoughts:
Another day where I had little time to do much of anything. I completed one simple exercise. But as I said before, there will be days like his, especially on the weekends. Over 100 days, no matter how short some days efforts are, the work and experience will add up.

## Day 6: December 10, 2017
### What I did:
Learned more advanced CSS Grid techniques such as grid-template-areas and the repeat technique.
### Thoughts:
Ah, my tutorial moves hella fast and I know I missed some things. For example, using naming in my repeat function... WHAT? I will go through the exercise tomorrow and hopefully get a better grasp.

## Day 7: December 11, 2017
### What I did:
Finished up the section on repeat functions as well as implementing minmax()
### Thoughts:
I continue to be very interested in CSS Grid. As these
techniques become more clear, I am able to visualize how awesome it truly will be to start using it in my projects. I hope to put more time into the lectures tomorrow so I can finish up the course by 12/13/2017

## Day 8: December 12, 2017
### What I did:
Completed two separate exercises that aim to reinforce grid areas and the repeat function.
### Thoughts:
This is starting to gel with me more and it is very exciting. I am anxious to build something using grid. Gotta finish the course first!

## Day 9: December 13, 2017
### What I did:
I completed a couple of exercises on auto-fill and auto-fit.
### Thoughts:
I am very frustrated right now because my learning resource is having technical issues in that all of my content is locked. I was ready to really dig in tonight and now I can't actually access the lectures. So yeah, that sucks.

## Day 10: December 14, 2017
### What I did:
I completed lectures on justify- and align- as well as completed exercises that reinforced the lectures.
### Thoughts:
This stuff is really cool and super simple. I am sure there are some advanced techniques but out of the box, this shit is powerful and simple. I imagine this is going to be a huge thing for html gaming.

## Day 11: December 15, 2017
### What I did:
I once again had problems with Mapt and couldn't access the content for the grid course. I decided to just start rebuilding the MN Tech site using CSS grid. I then ran into troubles with Node which caused me to have to completely reinstall. So basically, I did nothing but get the file structure laid out for the rebuild.
### Thoughts:
Annoyed and frustrated. Mapt is pissing me off.

## Day 12: December 16th, 2017
### What I did:
I continued with the CSS Grid course once I was able to access the content again, but as you could have guessed, I ran into another problem. There was missing content... I am nearly finished and am in the advanced chapter, but none of the content is actually there. I then switched over to the rebuild of the MN Tech site with css grid.
### Thoughts:
It's not as easy as I would have hoped, but I am confident I will start to get into the swing of things as I continue the build. I am unsure where I need to use traditional css techniques and where I can use grid... also, what kind of html architecture is necessary to get the most of grid? Hopefully I can get some answers when I get access to the missing content... If I don't get an answer by Monday, I am switching to a different content provider.

## Day 13: December 17, 2017
### What I did:
I didn't work at all today :(
### Thoughts:
It was a super busy Sunday and I just didn't find the time to sit down and work.

## Day 14: December 18, 2017
### What I did:
Well, my CSS Grid resource still is broken so I decided to try and just work on the site rebuild.
### Thoughts:
It didn't go very well... I am unsure how to target individual items within a grid element... I feel like I am missing something very obvious but a lot of the resources I found are very basic. I will continue to try and problem solve this but I have reached my hour limit for the night... I am frustrated.

## Day 15: December 19, 2017
### What I did:
I started a new course on Lynda to learn about CSS Grids.
### Thoughts:
Well, today I had to go backwards to move forwards and I am glad I did. I switch my learning resource to a Lynda course and I can already tell it is A LOT better. I was able to skip through the entry content and go right to the more advanced techniques, so that is exciting. I also now understand how named lines work, so that is awesome. I am very happy and feeling confident that I can cruise through what remains in this course and then really get down and dirty with grid when I rebuild the MNTech site.

## Day 16: December 20, 2017
### What I did:
I worked through nested grids while learning some other cool techniques such as ACTUALLY applying mobile first design and using the support function
### Thoughts:
I am so happy I switched learning resources... It is night and day. I will finish this course by Saturday and THEN REALLY start rebuilding the MN Tech site.

## Day 17: December 21, 2017
### What I did:
I worked on component based CSS Grid - building cards that can be placed within an HTML Document.
### Thoughts:
Hell yes, this is awesome.

## Day 18: December 22, 2017
### What I did:
I did not make any commits today
### Thoughts:
I spent the night with my wife and son and decided not to work at all.

## Day 19: December 23, 2017
### What I did:
I did a little bit of work with my Grid course tonight. I took my "component" grid cards and placed them inside a more "all-encompassing" grid
### Thoughts:
Another night where I did very little. The holidays are busy and its tough.

## Day 20: December 24, 2017
### What I did:
I did only a little bit tonight... it is Christmas Eve after all. I worked with stacking items inside a single grid cell as well as using flex box to compliement grid.
### Thoughts:
These nights of a short amount of work are not ideal because I feel like I am not really getting a chance to digest what I am learning. This just makes it all more important to build something once I finish the course.

## Day 21: December 25, 2017
### What I did:
Created a 'magazine' style layout and then workings on a accessible toggle menu
### Thoughts:
There were a few things that came up through the exercises that kind of through me off. They weren't things that had to do with grid properties but traditional CSS and pairing it up with Grid. I suppose the understanding will come with experience.

## Day 22: December 26, 2017
### What I did:
Implemented 2 version of scrolling sidebar nav... AND FINISHED THE COURSE!
### Thoughts:
Super cool and very excited to be done with the lecture part of this... It took 3 weeks but it was worth it. Now, my goal is to have the MN Tech site bebuilt with Grid by this time next week (Tuesday).

## Day 23: December 27, 2017
### What I did:
Began the rewrite of the MNTEch site using Grid. I began building the navigation.
### Thoughts:
This is a lot tougher when  you're doing it on your own. I really didn't get much done, but I am applying and that is what is really going to help me actually learn this stuff. I'm excited to get back at it tomorrow.
