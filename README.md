# 100DaysOfCode
The a challenge I have brought upon myself that will encourage me to code at least an hour a day. I have a lot of unfinished projects in this here repo that I intend to finish over the next ~3 months. I will learn some new things along the way as well.

## Day 1: December 5th, 2017
### What I did:
Set myself up to use VS Code
### Thoughts:
Well, I intended to begin work on understanding the new CSS grid stuff.. but I got caught up in implementing Visual Studio Code. I've been meaning to make the switch for a while now, but was always in the middle of something and didn't want to switch until I was starting something fresh.

## Day 2: December 6th, 2017
### What I did:
Was introduced to a couple of CSS Grid basics
### Thoughts:
Introduced to grid-template, grid-row-start/end and their shorthands. I got caught up in some VSCode stuff at the beginning... Its fast but I don't like not having all of my sweet Atom plugins.

## Day 3: December 7th, 2017
### What I did:
Completed the introductory lectures on defining grids
### Thoughts:
My wife and I went out to dinner with friends this evening so I took it very light tonight. I finished the lecture series on how to define grids and change there sizes, order, etc... All introductory stuff. I am feeling pretty good about this course.. And I except that fact I won't be able to hit this hard every single night.

## Day 4: December 8th, 2017
### What I did:
Completed an exercise that tested my introductory grid knowledge.
### Thoughts:
It was a lot more tricky to do it on my own than I would have expected. I actually had to take a peak at the solution to job my memory. I am glad I did though because after getting a small look, I was able to work through it and come to the solution on my own.

## Day 5: December 9th, 2017
### What I did:
Complete an exercise on grid order.
### Thoughts:
Another day where I had little time to do much of anything. I completed one simple exercise. But as I said before, there will be days like his, especially on the weekends. Over 100 days, no matter how short some days efforts are, the work and experience will add up.

## Day 6: December 10, 2017
### What I did:
Learned more advanced CSS Grid techniques such as grid-template-areas and the repeat technique.
### Thoughts:
Ah, my tutorial moves hella fast and I know I missed some things. For example, using naming in my repeat function... WHAT? I will go through the exercise tomorrow and hopefully get a better grasp.

## Day 7: December 11, 2017
### What I did:
Finished up the section on repeat functions as well as implementing minmax()
### Thoughts:
I continue to be very interested in CSS Grid. As these
techniques become more clear, I am able to visualize how awesome it truly will be to start using it in my projects. I hope to put more time into the lectures tomorrow so I can finish up the course by 12/13/2017

## Day 8: December 12, 2017
### What I did:
Completed two separate exercises that aim to reinforce grid areas and the repeat function.
### Thoughts:
This is starting to gel with me more and it is very exciting. I am anxious to build something using grid. Gotta finish the course first!

## Day 9: December 13, 2017
### What I did:
I completed a couple of exercises on auto-fill and auto-fit.
### Thoughts:
I am very frustrated right now because my learning resource is having technical issues in that all of my content is locked. I was ready to really dig in tonight and now I can't actually access the lectures. So yeah, that sucks.

## Day 10: December 14, 2017
### What I did:
I completed lectures on justify- and align- as well as completed exercises that reinforced the lectures.
### Thoughts:
This stuff is really cool and super simple. I am sure there are some advanced techniques but out of the box, this shit is powerful and simple. I imagine this is going to be a huge thing for html gaming.

## Day 11: December 15, 2017
### What I did:
I once again had problems with Mapt and couldn't access the content for the grid course. I decided to just start rebuilding the MN Tech site using CSS grid. I then ran into troubles with Node which caused me to have to completely reinstall. So basically, I did nothing but get the file structure laid out for the rebuild.
### Thoughts:
Annoyed and frustrated. Mapt is pissing me off.
