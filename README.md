# 100DaysOfCode
The a challenge I have brought upon myself that will encourage me to code at least an hour a day. I have a lot of unfinished projects in this here repo that I intend to finish over the next ~3 months. I will learn some new things along the way as well.

## Day 1: December 5th, 2017
### What I did: Set myself up to use VS Code
### Thoughts: Well, I intended to begin work on understanding the new CSS grid stuff.. but I got caught up in implementing Visual Studio Code. I've been meaning to make the switch for a while now, but was always in the middle of something and didn't want to switch until I was starting something fresh.

## Day 2: December 6th, 2017
### What I did: Was introduced to a couple of CSS Grid basics
### Thoughts: Introduced to grid-template, grid-row-start/end and their shorthands. I got caught up in some VSCode stuff at the beginning... Its fast but I don't like not having all of my sweet Atom plugins.
