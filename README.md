# 100DaysOfCode
The a challenge I have brought upon myself that will encourage me to code at least an hour a day. I have a lot of unfinished projects in this here repo that I intend to finish over the next ~3 months. I will learn some new things along the way as well.

## Day 1: December 5th, 2017
### What I did:
Set myself up to use VS Code
### Thoughts:
Well, I intended to begin work on understanding the new CSS grid stuff.. but I got caught up in implementing Visual Studio Code. I've been meaning to make the switch for a while now, but was always in the middle of something and didn't want to switch until I was starting something fresh.

## Day 2: December 6th, 2017
### What I did:
Was introduced to a couple of CSS Grid basics
### Thoughts:
Introduced to grid-template, grid-row-start/end and their shorthands. I got caught up in some VSCode stuff at the beginning... Its fast but I don't like not having all of my sweet Atom plugins.

## Day 3: December 7th, 2017
### What I did:
Completed the introductory lectures on defining grids
### Thoughts:
My wife and I went out to dinner with friends this evening so I took it very light tonight. I finished the lecture series on how to define grids and change there sizes, order, etc... All introductory stuff. I am feeling pretty good about this course.. And I except that fact I won't be able to hit this hard every single night.

## Day 4: December 8th, 2017
### What I did:
Completed an exercise that tested my introductory grid knowledge.
### Thoughts:
It was a lot more tricky to do it on my own than I would have expected. I actually had to take a peak at the solution to job my memory. I am glad I did though because after getting a small look, I was able to work through it and come to the solution on my own.

## Day 5: December 9th, 2017
### What I did:
Complete an exercise on grid order.
### Thoughts:
Another day where I had little time to do much of anything. I completed one simple exercise. But as I said before, there will be days like his, especially on the weekends. Over 100 days, no matter how short some days efforts are, the work and experience will add up.

## Day 6: December 10, 2017
### What I did:
Learned more advanced CSS Grid techniques such as grid-template-areas and the repeat technique.
### Thoughts:
Ah, my tutorial moves hella fast and I know I missed some things. For example, using naming in my repeat function... WHAT? I will go through the exercise tomorrow and hopefully get a better grasp.

## Day 7: December 11, 2017
### What I did:
Finished up the section on repeat functions as well as implementing minmax()
### Thoughts:
I continue to be very interested in CSS Grid. As these
techniques become more clear, I am able to visualize how awesome it truly will be to start using it in my projects. I hope to put more time into the lectures tomorrow so I can finish up the course by 12/13/2017

## Day 8: December 12, 2017
### What I did:
Completed two separate exercises that aim to reinforce grid areas and the repeat function.
### Thoughts:
This is starting to gel with me more and it is very exciting. I am anxious to build something using grid. Gotta finish the course first!

## Day 9: December 13, 2017
### What I did:
I completed a couple of exercises on auto-fill and auto-fit.
### Thoughts:
I am very frustrated right now because my learning resource is having technical issues in that all of my content is locked. I was ready to really dig in tonight and now I can't actually access the lectures. So yeah, that sucks.

## Day 10: December 14, 2017
### What I did:
I completed lectures on justify- and align- as well as completed exercises that reinforced the lectures.
### Thoughts:
This stuff is really cool and super simple. I am sure there are some advanced techniques but out of the box, this shit is powerful and simple. I imagine this is going to be a huge thing for html gaming.

## Day 11: December 15, 2017
### What I did:
I once again had problems with Mapt and couldn't access the content for the grid course. I decided to just start rebuilding the MN Tech site using CSS grid. I then ran into troubles with Node which caused me to have to completely reinstall. So basically, I did nothing but get the file structure laid out for the rebuild.
### Thoughts:
Annoyed and frustrated. Mapt is pissing me off.

## Day 12: December 16th, 2017
### What I did:
I continued with the CSS Grid course once I was able to access the content again, but as you could have guessed, I ran into another problem. There was missing content... I am nearly finished and am in the advanced chapter, but none of the content is actually there. I then switched over to the rebuild of the MN Tech site with css grid.
### Thoughts:
It's not as easy as I would have hoped, but I am confident I will start to get into the swing of things as I continue the build. I am unsure where I need to use traditional css techniques and where I can use grid... also, what kind of html architecture is necessary to get the most of grid? Hopefully I can get some answers when I get access to the missing content... If I don't get an answer by Monday, I am switching to a different content provider.

## Day 13: December 17, 2017
### What I did:
I didn't work at all today :(
### Thoughts:
It was a super busy Sunday and I just didn't find the time to sit down and work.

## Day 14: December 18, 2017
### What I did:
Well, my CSS Grid resource still is broken so I decided to try and just work on the site rebuild.
### Thoughts:
It didn't go very well... I am unsure how to target individual items within a grid element... I feel like I am missing something very obvious but a lot of the resources I found are very basic. I will continue to try and problem solve this but I have reached my hour limit for the night... I am frustrated.

## Day 15: December 19, 2017
### What I did:
I started a new course on Lynda to learn about CSS Grids.
### Thoughts:
Well, today I had to go backwards to move forwards and I am glad I did. I switch my learning resource to a Lynda course and I can already tell it is A LOT better. I was able to skip through the entry content and go right to the more advanced techniques, so that is exciting. I also now understand how named lines work, so that is awesome. I am very happy and feeling confident that I can cruise through what remains in this course and then really get down and dirty with grid when I rebuild the MNTech site.

## Day 16: December 20, 2017
### What I did:
I worked through nested grids while learning some other cool techniques such as ACTUALLY applying mobile first design and using the support function
### Thoughts:
I am so happy I switched learning resources... It is night and day. I will finish this course by Saturday and THEN REALLY start rebuilding the MN Tech site.

## Day 17: December 21, 2017
### What I did:
I worked on component based CSS Grid - building cards that can be placed within an HTML Document.
### Thoughts:
Hell yes, this is awesome.

## Day 18: December 22, 2017
### What I did:
I did not make any commits today
### Thoughts:
I spent the night with my wife and son and decided not to work at all.

## Day 19: December 23, 2017
### What I did:
I did a little bit of work with my Grid course tonight. I took my "component" grid cards and placed them inside a more "all-encompassing" grid
### Thoughts:
Another night where I did very little. The holidays are busy and its tough.

## Day 20: December 24, 2017
### What I did:
I did only a little bit tonight... it is Christmas Eve after all. I worked with stacking items inside a single grid cell as well as using flex box to compliement grid.
### Thoughts:
These nights of a short amount of work are not ideal because I feel like I am not really getting a chance to digest what I am learning. This just makes it all more important to build something once I finish the course.

## Day 21: December 25, 2017
### What I did:
Created a 'magazine' style layout and then workings on a accessible toggle menu
### Thoughts:
There were a few things that came up through the exercises that kind of through me off. They weren't things that had to do with grid properties but traditional CSS and pairing it up with Grid. I suppose the understanding will come with experience.

## Day 22: December 26, 2017
### What I did:
Implemented 2 version of scrolling sidebar nav... AND FINISHED THE COURSE!
### Thoughts:
Super cool and very excited to be done with the lecture part of this... It took 3 weeks but it was worth it. Now, my goal is to have the MN Tech site be built with Grid by this time next week (Tuesday).

## Day 23: December 27, 2017
### What I did:
Began the rewrite of the MNTEch site using Grid. I began building the navigation.
### Thoughts:
This is a lot tougher when  you're doing it on your own. I really didn't get much done, but I am applying and that is what is really going to help me actually learn this stuff. I'm excited to get back at it tomorrow.

## Day 24: December 28, 2017
### What I did:
Finished the rewrite of the navbar with css grid
### Thoughts:
Feels better to do some CSS grid in real life. It was pretty tough yesterday but even after a couple of days in implementing it, it is coming a little more naturally.

## Day 25: December 29, 2017
### What I did:
I didn't do any coding today :( Christmas stuff.

# Day 26: December 30th, 2017
### What I did:
I finished writing the navbar and also finished writing the landing page for the MN Tech rewrite.
### Thoughts:
CSS Grid wails. Now that I am using it in practice it's intuitiveness is
really shining. I love it!

# Day 27: December 31, 2017
### What I did:
NOthing. Stewpid holidays! Back on track tomorrow!

# Day 28: January 1, 2018
### What I did:
I made a few styling changes to the landing and navbar. Then I got cracking on the home page. I got the grid laid out and I also got the
page header ready to roll
### Thoughts:
This CSS Grid thing kicks ass. That's all there is to say about it.

# Day 30: January 2, 2018
### What I did:
Continued the rebuild of the MN Tech site by finishing the home page minus a few media queries needed before mobile layout is reached.
### Thoughts:
I'm cruising along. GRID WAILS.

# Day 31: January3, 2018
### What I did:
Nothing. We went out for happy hour and that was the end of me :(

# Day 32: January 4, 2018
### What I did:
Set the media queries for the home page.
### Thoughts:
I didn't get much grid practice tonight... Mostly boring media query stuff. I am starting to feel like I want to finish this rebuild asap so I can move on to the next topic. I now have working knowledge of grid and I don't want to get bogged down on this site build for too long.

# Day 33: January 5th, 2018
### What I did:
I missed another day. CRIPES!

# Day 34: January 6th, 2018
### What I did:
Began work on about page and reorganized some CSS.
### Thoughts:
I have really focused on organizing my code - my CSS in particular - properly. It is really satisfying and is increasing my building efficiency.

# Day 35: January 8th, 2018
### What I did:
I used CSS Grid to dominate the members section of the about page.
### Thoughts:
This is definitely more challenging now that I am dealing with more content. Grid is great when making an overall layout, at it is great for nested grids as well... but it definitely takes a little more care once you started trying to organize more content within grid items.

# Day 36: January 9th: 2018
### What I did:
I am playing with some 'ng-if' effects using angularjs
### Thoughts:
Mission creep can't set in. I need to finish these transitions tomorrow so I can get this site done and up. however, if these work out the way I want them to, it will look sweet.

# Day 37: January 10th, 2018
### What I did:
Nothing. I am a slacker.

# Day 38: January 11, 2018
### What I did:
Nothing again. Damnit.

# Day 39: January 12, 2018
### What I did:
I finished the about page with the exception to media queries.
### Thoughts:
It's been one of those weeks... Work is boring and I'm not super motivated. No excuses. Starting a streak tomorrow!

# Day 42: January 15th, 2018
### What I did:
used grid to set up the forms for the site.
### Thoughts:
The ease the grid gives me to align items - forms in this case - never ceases to amaze me.

# Day 44: January 17th, 2018
### What I did:
I made a SCRUM like board listing what remains to do on the MN Tech rebuild. I completely finished all media queries and got form styling monolithic across all (most) major browsers.
### Thoughts:
I am glad I made the SCRUM like list... It will help keep me focused and it feels good to cross things off the board. As I had feared however, this project is dragging on and I am not excited... This 100 days of code is great, but I am spinning my wheels here. NEW GOAL: HAVE THIS DONE BY DAY 50 and have a great 2nd half!

# Day 46: January 19th, 2018
### What I did:
Built the grid layout for the portfolio page and inserted and organized the grid items
### Thoughts:
I am well established with Grid now, which is awesome. Now I just need to finish the GD website. Day 50 is approaching!

# Day 47: January 20th, 2018
### What I did:
Inserted the rest of the portfolio content.
### Thoughts:
Still grinding....

# Day 48: January 21th, 2018
### What I did:
I added the new portfolio page to the navigating and got the page repsonsive. I also created the grid for the sidebar banner wraps.
### Thoughts:
I made some good progress today, I was super excited to see how easy CSS grid made it to make the side bar wraps that will be visible up until 1110px width. And holy shit, I am so full of anxiety because the Vikings play in the NFC Championship game tonight. SKOL VIKINGS!

# Day 52: January 25th, 2018
### What I did:
Struggled with getting the right thing to return in my route because I am struggling with the asynchroncity of JS. I am extremely frustrated. BIG SURPRISE.
### Thoughts:
I'm taking a shower and going to bed.

# Day 55: January 28th, 2018
### What I did:
Set up the form to clear on submission.
### Thoughts:
I am moving on from the aysynchronous problem I was having... I want to figure it out but I am in dire need of completing this site... THIS SHIT IS DRAGGING ON! So, I just used setPristine and setUnctouched to clear the text inputs once it is submitted. Firefox is setting the input borders to the required color, which is annoying.

# Day 56: January 29th, 2018
### What I did:
Got rid of all uses of css variables, getting ready for progressive enhancement. Worked on a solution for the landing page not taking up the whole screen width but I kept coming back to the original problem. I will need to find a new solution
### Thoughts:
Getting closer. Very close actually. I just keep getting stuck on these seemingly small problems. I will sleep on this and have a solution tomrrow.

# Day 57: January 30th, 2018
### What I did:
Favicon, fixed landing page mishaps, began mobile styling via media Queries
### Thoughts:
So close!

# Day 58: January 31st, 2018
### What I did:
Built the navigation hamburger for mobile navigation as well as started mobile styling for content pages
### Thoughts:
I turned off my top level grid for mobile but my nested grids are still intact - that is awesome because it will save me a lot of work in some places

# Day 59: February 1st, 2018
### What I did:
Completed all of the media queries for the home page and also used flex box for the footer.
### Thoughts:
I will have this done by the end of the weekend. Chyeah!

# Day 60: February 2nd, 2018
### What I did:
Completed all media queries for all pages - with exception to the survey and mobile navigation.
### Thoughts:
Used grid a lot tonight, still loving it.

# Day 61: February 3rd, 2018
### What I did:
Mobile Navigation complete.
### Thoughts:
I want to add some transition to the mobile nav but it's date night... I might just have to move on because I want to finish this thing... We'll see... no pressure!

# Day 63: February 5th, 2018
### What I did:
I finished the MnTech site using grid. I think it is an improvement from the first go around. I also launced it on Digital Ocean.
### Thoughts:
Ah, that's better. I'm glad to have learned Grid and now I can use it going forward. Still a little annoyed it took me nearly 2/3s of the 100 days to finish, but it is what it is. Now I can move on to something new!

# Day 64: February 6th, 2018
### What I did:
I took a break from coding this evening to do a little bit of research on what to study next. I was going back and forth between finally taking on some game development, Angular (not angularjs), or Vue.js, or something that will be SQL intensive. I've chosen to study Angular... Vue and React are all the rage right now... But I am going to put my trust in the mega Google on this one. Plus, if I don't like it, I can always move on. After I finish studying Angular, I am going to rebuild and finish a site I started called VG API that uses and video game API built by a company called Giant Bomb. I will of course be using CSS Grid in that project. I also want to try and think of ways to incorporate some more complicated SQL into the project because my experience with it is severely lacking.

# Day 65, February 7th, 2018
### What I did:
I took my first step into learning Angular by scaffolding my first project. I was able to instantly spin up a server and run a test, which was neat.
### Thoughts:
Super introductory and therefore I don't have much to go on but I liked it so far... I didn't even have to write a server file, which was rad. Also, this resource uses typescript, so that will be on awesome experience.

# Day 66, February 8th, 2018
### What I did:
I built out a Pomodoro timer component
### Thoughts:
I'm really enjoying Angular so far. I am trying to use my Mapt subscription again to see if they can redeem themselves after that CSS Grid debacle... So far, i am mixed feelings. The resource is really good at some points, but very poor in others. It is only the first chapter too so that is not the best sign. I will stick with it through chapter 2 and reasses afterwards... If I haven't gotten a good vibe from the resource by then, I will switch over to Lynda, which is always legit.

# Day 67, February 14th, 2018
### What I did:
Dove deaper into the intracracies of TypeScript via my Angular learning resource.
### Thoughts:
Yeah, I know that there is a 6 day gap between the 8th and 14th... But I got sick with something fierce and have been out of commission until today... So in my mind, this is day 67, not 72.

# Day 68, February 15th, 2018
### What I did:
I completed reading the chapter on TypeScript.
### Thoughts:
Damn, that was way longer than I realized, I was hoping to be back into Angular tonight. That all good though... Reading the chapter was a good refresher in ES6 and cool because TypeScript has a lot of similarties to Java, which lowers my barriers to entry. Excited to get back into Angular components tomorrow!

# Day 72, February 19th, 2018
### What I did:
Oh man, I FINALLY ACTUALLY FINISHED my TypeScript study. The chapter never ended and was complicated, so I took the opporunity to study a few different resources.
### Thoughts
TypeScript is a whole new world. I am excited to get back into building as it seemed to get a bit too academic for my liking. Putting it's features to work by building some things will certainly help make sense of everything.

# Day 73, February 20th, 2018
### What I did:
Fumbled around with this crap resource from Mapt. I am done with this book and with Mapt.
### Thoughts:
After the first chapter I was worried about this resource. Then there was an indepth dive into TypeScript, and I enjoyed that. Then I got back into the chapters where we actually build components and my fears were realized... Poor instructions on the simplest things like where in the file directory we are putting this file... And the imports needed for the files... Just pure crap for a beginner into the framework. I wrote them and told them I was done using there service and asked for a refund... Hopefully I can get one. I will start another Angular course tomorrow on Lynda.

# Day 74, February 21st, 2018
### What I did:
I switched to a new resource from Lynda.com. I ran into some configuration problem with my tsconfig.json file, which took awhile to trouble shoot. Anyways, I basically went over what I already learned earlier last week.
### Thoughts: 
A frustrating evening seeing as I really didn't accomplish anything. Trying to get these configured correctly is such a hassle... IDK how anyone is supposed to remember all of this crap. Anyways, I will get back at it tomorrow and hopefully spend more time learning and less time configuring.

# Day 76, February 23rd, 2018
### What I did:
I am taking in a quick tutorial of Golang.
### Thoughts:
I have a job opporunity that uses Golang. It is not required to complete the code challenge in that language but I am going to give it a shot anyways. I hope I don't regret this decision! I won't though... I've got until the end of day Tuesday to make a simple REST Api.

# Day 77, February 24th, 2018
### What I did:
Worked with inputting/outputting values to the console in Go. Also used various packages include bufio, strings, os, fmt, and strconv. Also, the math package
### Thoughts:
This is cool, and even if I don't end up landing this job (but I am going to) this isn't all for naught (not?). I am certainly appreciating learning a new language and seeing how they implement things differently than say, Java.

# Day 78, February 25, 2018
### What I did:
Learned about arrays, structs, maps, slices, and pointers
### Thoughts:
I am really digging this Golang stuff. I think I am excited mostly because I now have experience with 4/5 different languages and it is cool to see the similarities and the differences between them. I feel that this familiarity really makes picking up new languages easier. I gotta finish this course tomorrow though because I gotta start building this thing for the code challenge so I CAN GET THIS JOB!

# Day 80, February 27, 2018
### What I did:
Completed an introductory course on Go programming. Today I learned how to read and write files, traverse directories, make web requests, parse JSON, and spin up a local server
### Thoughts:
I really like this language. The syntax is easy and flexible and it has great support and documentation. I am worried I will not be able to complete this code challenge on time, but I am going to give it my best shot. Regardless, I am going to finish it and turn it in. If nothing else, i have learned a new and valuable skill.

# Day 81, February 28, 2018
### What I did:
I started a tutorial where we build a library like web application. Using SQLite3 I have set up an application that calls the Classify API and then stores some books in our books table
### Thoughts:
I like it. I kinda wish I would have used something like Postgres or MySQL seeing as it took me a long time to get SQLite3 up and running - stupid gcc! Anyway, I am enjoying making a full stack application again, it has been too long

# Day 82, March 1st, 2018
### What I did:
I was introduced to some web middleware called Negorni. I also built my own middleware function. Also, I built out the schema for the programming challenge.

### Thoughts:
Negroni seems like it makes things a lot easier and I am curious what other, more popular frameworks, have to offer. 

# Day 83, March 2nd, 2018
### What I did:
Added post route to post saved books from DB
### Thoughts:
Cool

# Day 84, March 3rd, 2018
### What I did:
Add delete functionality to my book collection
### Thoughts:
I know how to do CRUD with GO! It's cool. I am excited to finish this course and remake my VG API using Go.

# Day 85, March 5th, 2018
### What I did:
Implemented a package called gorp that is a database wrapper.
### Thoughts:
Gorp is supposedly supposed to make accessing the DB easier and I believe that is true. It cut the amount of code by at leat 75%. I think I will grasp it better when I implement it into my own project.

# Day 86, March 6th, 2018
### What I did:
Added session storage and column sorting ability to book collection
### Thoughts:
Once this course is over I really need to sit down and look at all of the documentation for these libraries I'm using outside of the Standard Go Libarary - I should study that too. Tonight in particular I felt lost going through the tutorial. That is the other tough part of working all day and doing this stuff at the end of the night... I am real tired and the energy level isn't what it always needs to be to get the best out of this.

# Day 91, March 11th, 2018
### What I did:
I've completed enough of the Go tut to start building out my own project. Tonight, I researched how I will begin combining Go with Angular 2x. I have a plan of action. First, I will get a functional and basic back-end built w/ Go in which I am able to make calls to Giant Bomb API and recieve results. I will then set up the proper routes to build the basics of a CRUD using data from Giant Bomb. Once all of the basic CRUD operations are in place, I will start implementing my Angular. 
### Thoughts: 
Enough learning! Time to start building.
